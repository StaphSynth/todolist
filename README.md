# todolist
This is an AngularJS 'To-Do' List inspired by the [TodoMVC example](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/). See it in action [here](http://syntheta.se/coding/2017/02/21/AngularJS-todo-list.html).

It doesn't yet cache the user's tasks to disk, as I'm still learning about Angular services and so on, but it's mostly complete otherwise.

Could do with some tests, though, and better (ie, some) separation of concerns.
